## Test Plan

* Define the API endpoints to be tested and the scope of the testing.
* Identify the input parameters required by each API endpoint, including headers, query parameters, and request bodies.
* Identify the expected output for each API endpoint, including response codes, response bodies, and any other relevant output.
* Determine the automation framework and tools to be used for testing the API endpoints.
* Develop test cases that cover all possible scenarios for the API endpoints, including both positive and negative test cases.
* Create test data and test environment setup for testing the API endpoints.
* Execute the test cases and report any issues or bugs found during testing.
* Analyze the results of the testing and identify areas for improvement.
* Automate the regression testing process to ensure that any changes to the API endpoints do not break existing functionality.
* Integrate the API automation testing with the CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing and deployment.
* Ensure that the API automation test plan is maintained and updated as new features and endpoints are added to the API.
